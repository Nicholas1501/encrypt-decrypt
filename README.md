This is a terminal-based text encryption and decryption program. After finishing it, I plan to code a user friendly application for it. For now, I will make it as user friendly as possible with terminal feedback.
While developing it, test_sourcecode will contain unit tests, to make sure that the encryption and decryption functionalitys are working as planned.
